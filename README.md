## Why I created it?
These games have been brought up to me by my girlfriend. Being in a long distance relationship, these games provide a genuine way to spend some time together (even if over videochat).
I promise that even if they are simpler than the common nowdays game, they hide a lot of challenge.

My learning method sees the alternation of two different behaviours: first, I read about new topics and collect them mentally; when it's time, I concretize them all into a project. I find this approach more beneficial than creating a lot of small, easily forgotten, projects.
